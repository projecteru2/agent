# vim: ft=yaml

# pid defines the path to pid file.
# This option is not required as the default value is "/tmp/agent.pid".
pid: /tmp/agent.pid

# core defines the address of eru-core component.
# This option is not required as the default value is "127.0.0.1:5001".
core:
  - 127.0.0.1:5001
  - 127.0.0.1:5002

# heartbeat_interval defines the interval for eru-agent to
# report health status of the node to eru-core.
# This option is not required, and is only useful when enabling
# selfmon mode.
# If you don't want eru-agent to report this status, set it to 0.
# The default value of this option is 0.
heartbeat_interval: 120

# auth defines the authentication values for eru-core.
#
# auth.username and auth.password are the username and password required by eru-core.
# If eru-core doesn't require authentication, you can remove this option.
auth:
  username: username
  password: password

# docker defines docker config.
#
# docker.endpoint is the url that eru-agent will use to connect to.
# This URL can be a tcp address like "tcp://10.233.10.14:2376",
# or a unix socket file path like "unix:///var/run/docker/sock",
# this option is required and has no default value, you must set it.
# Note that this endpoint is usually the API URL of docker on local machine.
docker:
  endpoint: unix:///var/run/docker.sock

# metrics defines where should eru-agent send metrics of containers to.
#
# metrics.step defines the interval of collecting metrics action. eru-agent
# will collect metrics every `metrics.step` seconds. The default value is 10.
#
# metrics.transfers defines where eru-agent will send metrics to.
# Currently it supports Statsd and Prometheus. The default value is empty,
# which means eru-agent will not send metrics.
metrics:
  step: 30
  transfers:
    - 127.0.0.1:8125

# api defines the API interface for eru-agent.
#
# api.addr defines the address of HTTP API service.
# API provides these APIs:
#   - /profile/, will do pprof for eru-agent process and return the statistics;
#   - /version/, will return the version of this eru-agent instance;
#   - /log/?app=$APPNAME, will return the log stream of corresponding app;
#   - /metrics/, default metrics handler for Prometheus to collect.
# If you don't need any of the functions above, you can remove this option,
# then eru-agent will not provide HTTP API service.
api:
  addr: 127.0.0.1:12345

# log defines where should eru-agent forward logs of containers to.
#
# log.forwards defines the targets.
# Currently we support these kinds of targets:
#   - tcp stream, like rsyslog with tcp protocol, e.g. "tcp://127.0.0.1:5144";
#   - udp stream, like rsyslog with udp protocol, e.g. "udp://127.0.0.1:5144";
#   - journald, e.g. "journal://".
#
# log.stdout defines whether eru-agent will also write log to STDOUT
# while forwarding to remote logging facility.
# The default value is false if you don't define this option.
# Which means you can check the log of containers in remote logging facility,
# but you can't see the log of containers in eru-agent's log.
log:
  forwards:
    - tcp://127.0.0.1:5144
  stdout: false

# healthcheck defines how eru-agent does healthcheck.
#
# healthcheck.interval defines the interval for eru-agent to check health status of all containers.
# The default value is 60, which means every 60 seconds, eru-agent will check health status of all
# containers, and report these data to eru-core. If these data should expire, the time to expire
# will be 2.5 * healthcheck.interval, in case that eru-agent failed to report for current round
# but succeeded to report in next round. E.g. if you set healthcheck.interval to 60, the TTL will be
# 2.5 * 60 = 150 (in seconds).
#
# healthcheck.timeout defines the timeout for eru-agent to check health status.
# eru-agent will connect to the port container publishes and then check (either layer-2 connectivity or layer-7 application provided scenarios),
# timeout is used for this connection and check. The default value is 10 (in seconds).
#
# healthcheck.cache_ttl defines how long will eru-agent cache an unchanged status locally.
# This is only used when selfmon mode is switched on. The default value is 300 (in seconds).
#
# healthcheck.enable_selfmon defines whether selfmon is switched on.
# This should be true if there's at least one eru-agent is in mode selfmon.
# When this is true, healthcheck.enable_selfmon and heartbeat_interval is meaningless.
healthcheck:
  interval: 120
  timeout: 10
  cache_ttl: 300
  enable_selfmon: false

# global_connection_timeout defines the timeout for eru-agent other than healthcheck.
# E.g. the timeout for reporting action of eru-agent, or the timeout for eru-agent to
# connect to docker.
# The default value is "5s", note that "s" in the end.
global_connection_timeout: 15s

# etcd defines the etcd configuration.
# This option is required and has no default value.
# If you don't plan to run this eru-agent in selfmon mode,
# you can give a mocked value e.g. 127.0.0.1:1111,
# this value won't be used to connect, it's only to pass
# the validation of this option (it's tricky).
# Will plan to improve this in next release.
#
# etcd.machines defines the addresses of etcd machines.
#
# etcd.prefix defines the prefix for eru-agents in selfmon mode.
# This prefix should be the same for all eru-agents in selfmon mode,
# and also distinguished for different ERU clusters.
etcd:
  machines:
    - 127.0.0.1:2379
  prefix: /agent-selfmon
